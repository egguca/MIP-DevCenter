<p class="blurb-text text-center mt-3 px-3"> What is the "Mobile Iterator Project?"
<br>
<br>
The "Mobile Iterator Project" details a Rain World <b> Alternate Universe </b> focused around the titular Project and its relevant characters. It's primarily focused on Original Characters rather than pre-existing ones, and the lore and themes <b> differ quite drastically </b> from both Vanilla and Downpour. There are major elements of world-building that do not comply with either canon; be warned. (also sacrilege) It takes inspiration from others' OC-focused fanworks like Daszombes' "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J41WOb_Lsa0&list=PLUl8awHLnNLyb3Spg1QEI2uiOUx98ql_l">Iterator Logs</a>" and my friends' worldbuilding and characters. My friends have helped me a lot! ^^
<br>
<br>
Here's the in-universe Mission Statement:</p>

	<blockquote class="blockquote">
		<p class="blurb-text text-left px-3 !important"> The “Mobile Iterator Project” (MIP) is a project created and directed by a Benefactor named "No Cost Too Great" (NCTG) with the stated goal of supporting Iterators in their productivity, maintenance, and longevity, so that they can operate at maximum efficiency, even after an inevitable public mass-ascension. 'MIP Units'—Iterators created under the project—are created puppet-first in the "MIP Development Center" and later assigned to Local Groups, where their structures are built to support the Iterators around them.
<br>
			<br>
Uniquely, their personalities are heavily based around singular, specific Architects (Benefactors) who donate their memories and qualia. The exception to this is TWR, who features a more traditional personality module. In total, there are 99 MIP Units, with IDs ranging from 01 to 99.</p>
	</blockquote>

<p class="blurb-text text-center mt-3 px-3"> The impetus for this AU was asking "If the Iterators are left behind as Gifts to the World for possible millennia, who shall take care of them?" Of course all Iterators come with various self-repair technologies (like in Downpour!), but there are certain tasks that would be better-fit for a sentient being to help with, such as degradation of communications arrays or delivery. MIP Units are modeled after the Benefactors (Iterator-Builders) specifically to ensure that their presence shall never truly be absent.
<br>
<br>
"What is Rain World?" a cool awesome indie game you should buy and play RIGHT NOW. but if for some reason you've stumbled onto here without already knowing, here's a link to the wiki's entry on <a href="https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/Iterator">Iterators</a>, I guess. 
<br>
	<br> If you have any questions about anything, you can send an ask to my Tumblr or send me a DM somewhere. Strawpage sort of works, but it's better for more casual questions, since it doesn't have any sort of archival for answers. Links are under the Links tab. Thank you!

	<h2> Q: What is a MIP Unit? </h2>
	<br>
	<p class="blurb-text px-2" style="font-size:90%"> MIP Units are mobile Iterator Puppets created under the Mobile Iterator Project. They are a unique (and trademarked) classification of "Mobile Iterator", though their status is somewhat contested. Within the Project, each MIP Unit is classified by an ID, ranging from 01 to 99. They are assigned Specialized ID Drones that are necessary to their functionality. Their signature doll-like design makes them great for display.
<br>
		<br>
Notably, every MIP Unit (except TWR) is based off of an existing Architect/Benefactor that has donated memories and qualia to form a Personality Base. These are referred to as "Personality Donors", and their identities are kept private out of respect to all parties involved. (With a few exceptions, like NMMST.) This personality data gives them the perspective of an Architect, allowing them to serve their Successors. Their capabilities are similar to those of the average Architect, though their status as machines allows them greater intelligence and productivity. It should be noted that MIP Units, as purposed organisms, are not classified as Citizens, and they do not possess the legal rights afforded by Citzenship.
		<br>
		<br>

MIP Units are constructed in the Mobile Iterator Project Development Center. Each MIP Unit is assigned to a Local Group through a process titled "Group Assignment". Once a Group Assignment has been received, MIP Units receive specialized education and training to perform their respective duties. MIP Units are given Superstructures within their respective Local Groups, which focus on Utility (such as Material Production) over Raw Computational Strength. These are much smaller than normal Iterator structures to minimize environmental disruption and save on resources. MIP Units can connect to their Superstructures to perform various tasks, though they cannot Iterate. When a MIP Unit has been properly integrated into their Local Group, they are said to have completed their "Local Group Integration".  
<br>
		<br>
House Representatives may commission a MIP Unit to be assigned to Local Groups under their respective Houses. They can request certain Roles or Functions for their Units (Such as a Dedicated Repair Technician), but they cannot request specific Personalities, as this would conflict with the Project's Vision. Houses may also influence the Design of their Unit(s), but the Personality Donors are given ultimate Creative Control. Generally, MIP Units favor appealing and expressive designs above overt functionality, but limitations may be supplemented by their assigned Local Groups if desired. MIP Units lack strength, but their lightweight constructions allows for easier handling and transport. Most Units come with a handle at the base of their neck.</p>
<br>
<h2> Q: Who Owns a MIP Unit? </h2>
<br><p class="blurb-text px-2" style="font-size:90%">MIP Units are ultimately property of the Mobile Iterator Project, but they are functionally the property of their respective Local Groups. Local Groups (and their respective Houses) possess Administrative permissions over their Assigned MIP Units, including access to surveillance via ID Drone. The Mobile Iterator Project possesses similar permissions, though they are not utilized often outside of Routine Status Check-ins performed by the Project's Assistants. MIP Units are tasked with performing duties assigned to them by their Local Groups, and they are expected to show deference to their Groupmates. Units that struggle with insubordinate or disruptive tendencies may require Maintenace or Re-Assignment. In the case that a Local Group or House abuses its permissions, ownership may be revoked and the Unit(s) recalled.</p>

This text blurb exists to gatekeep the container from getting too narrow. Hopefully. Click this to expand the group. </p></a>      
<div id="basicterms" class="collapse">
<br>
<p class="blurb-text px-2" style="font-size:90%"> <b>Architect:</b> Term for a member of the civlization that built the Iterators.
<br>
<br>
<b>Benefactor:</b> A term for Architects that contribute to the development of Iterator Projects. Coloquially, a term for Architects of high social standing and wealth.
<br>
<br>
<b>Local Group:</b> A collection of several Iterators (and their respective Cities), generally within the same "Sector." Position within a Sector is denoted by one or two smaller letters corresponding to cardinal direction. (c for center, s for south, ne for northeast, etc) They have their own hierarchies, and their members, both Iterator and Citizen, tend to work together. The number of Iterators in a LG varies. The House(s) and Cities of each Local Group cooperate with one another in various fashions. Comprised of Local Councils. (Probably)
<br>
<span style="font-size:90%; color:#a4a2a9;"> <em> ◦ Ex: Silent Valley Local Group (Sector S2), Everlasting Lotus Waters (S2e) </em> </span>
<br>
	<br>
<b>Group Senior:</b> The eldest member of a Local Group. Takes on administrative and managerial duties in regards to its other members, to varying degrees. Depends on the House(s) behind the members of said Local Group.
<br> 
<span style="font-size:90%; color:#a4a2a9;"> <em> ◦ Ex: Everlasting Lotus Waters</em> </span>
<br>
	<br>

<b>Group Supervisor:</b> A member of the Local Group who takes on the responsibilities of the Group Senior despite not being the eldest unit. Generally given in circumstances where a Group Senior is unable to effectively perform their duties or due to outside influence ("Wealthy House Said So").
<br>
<span style="font-size:80%; color:#a4a2a9;"> I'm like 90% sure I subconsciously lifted this from Daszombes's Iterator Logs so Obligatory Plug</span>
<br>
<span style="font-size:90%; color:#a4a2a9;"> <em> ◦ Ex: Perpetual Umbra</em> </span>
<br>
	<br>

<b>Administrative Representative:</b> A individual that communicates between an Iterator's Administrative Team and the corresponding Iterator. Administrative teams vary in size and roles, from technicians to policy-makers. Iterators with only one active Administrative Team member may refer to said individual as "Administrator". For No Cost Too Great, this is the case. 
<br>
<span style="font-size:90%; color:#a4a2a9;"> <em> ◦ Ex: NCTG (PU, TWR, SLS, FB)</em> </span>
<br>
	<br>

<b>Creator:</b> An uncommon title for an Individual primarily responsible for the creation of an Iterator Unit. Most Iterator Projects necessitate the cooperation of multiple individuals, so reserving this title for one person is rather egotistical. <span style="color:#a4a2a9;"> (Since MIP Units are so much smaller in scale, it's... <em>slightly</em> less haughty for NCTG to adopt this title.) </span>
<br>
<br> House (i.e. House Of Progress): A political and cultural faction officially recognized by the Global Council. Iterators (and their Cities) are credited to the House(s) responsible for their creation, though their official affiliation may lie with a different House or even multiple Houses. The dominant Affiliation is generally responsible for management / governance, and their influence is the strongest. Houses may have multiple Iterators, and they may be within the same or different Local Groups. MIP Units are always at least partially affiliated with the House Of Progress.

	<br> <span style="font-size:90%; color:#a4a2a9;"> <em> ◦ Ex: (Iterator with a differing Affiliation) "Iterator Project Sand-Smoothed Reckoning, Of the House of Progress, Gift to the World From the House of Radiance..."</em> </span>
	<br> <span style="font-size:90%; color:#a4a2a9;"><em> ◦ Ex: (Iterator with multiple Affiliations) "Iterator Project Everlasting Lotus Waters, Of the House of Still Waters and the House of Progress, Gift to the World From the House of Still Waters... </em> </span>
	<br> 
<br> <b> The Great Problem: </b> A "problem" that seeks a solution to finding a way to ascend every living (and nonliving) being, including the Lesser Beings of the world that lack the natural capacity for enlightenment. Iterators were (at least originally) created to solve it. 
	<br>
<br> <b> The Global Council:</b> The highest political authority. Representative assembly elected from constituent Houses. Maintains political infrastructure throughout all Local Groups (enforcing ownership of Cities, etc.) and focuses on other large-scale concerns. For example, the Council was responsible for overseeing public mass-ascension. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<b> Councillor: </b> An acting member of the Global Council.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b> The Ethics Committe: </b> Legal infrastructure of the Global Council. Most legal matters are handled on a Local Group or level (Local Ethics Committee), but particularly pressing issues may be held to a higher accountability.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Void Fluid Research Committee: </b> Oversees and sponsors research related to Void Fluid and the Void Sea. Works on a global level, with outreach to various Local Groups. Has been known to help certain controversial Projects get past the Ethics Committees (on the grounds that one that does not properly understand their field cannot properly determine its ethicality).

  <div id="mipterms" class="collapse">
	<br>
	<p class="blurb-text px-2" style="font-size:90%"> <b> Director: </b> The Director of the Mobile Iterator Project. They orchestrate and organize its members and goals. "Director" is a title of respect, and MIP Units generally address No Cost Too Great with this honorific. (It's catchier than saying Mx. Cost, so even people unrelated to the Project will often refer to them as "the Director"). 
	<br>
		<br> <b> Assistant: </b> Title for MIP Units that have managerial responsibilities and carry out the Director's will. They are right under the Director in the MIP Unit hieararchy. These Units have certain administrative privileges over other MIP Units (and each other), and they are directly overseen by No Cost Too Great themself.
		<br>
		<br> <b> Implement: </b> A fancy title for Units that serve the Mobile Iterator Project in their duties. Like employees, basically. For example, Plume Of Embers is involved in manufacturing merchandise, and Seafoam, Glimmering In Sunlight serves as the Head of Security. They are beneath Assistants in the hierarchy, but above regular MIP Units.
		<br>
		<br> <b>MIP Unit: </b> Mobile Iterator Units specifically constructed under the Mobile Iterator Project. Not to be confused with other Mobile Iterators or Standard Iterators with mobile puppets. MIP Units are their own classification of purposed organism, though they may also be classified as a specific subset of "Mobile Iterator" under Iterator classification standards. Bootlegged productions are illegal. (You can view their general schematics <a href="https://toyhou.se/28365003.mip-unit-overview"> here </a>)
		<br>
		<br> <b> Personality Donor: </b> Every MIP Unit (except TWR) is built from a personality base made up of qualia and memories donated by specific architects. These are referred to as Personality Donors, though their identities are kept private out of respect to all parties involved.
		<br>
		<br> <b> MIP Development Center:</b> The building in which MIP Units are assembled, activated, and developed. This building also serves as a center to interface with clients, and it is split into several wings depending on the function. (Conferencing Wing, General Development Wing, Administrative Wing) The building is located in Sand-Smoothed Reckoning's Mesa City.
		<br>
	<br> <b> Group Assignment: </b> The process by which MIP Units are assigned to support Local Groups. Once they receive a Group Assignment, MIP Units receive specialized education and/or training to suit the needs of their respective Groups. They also spend time introducing themselves to their groupmates and familiarizing themselves with their respective Houses and Administrators. Once this process has been completed, a MIP Unit reaches <b>Local Group Integration </b> and officially leaves the Development Center. Certain units (Assistants and FB) must receive delayed Group Assignments due to extenuating circumstances.

		Generally, my timestuff works with tenths and fifths, given the religious significance of 10 (Highest Karmic State) and 5 (The Five Urges). I also base stuff around wheels due to the Cycle's nature as something that is ever-turning. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<b> Cycle: </b> In Iterator/Architect scale, this is somewhat close in <em> significance </em> to a day, probably. I'm not making conversions to human time, sorry. 
	<br> - Notation: [0000.001] 
	<br>
	<br> <b> Micro-Cycle: </b> A finer unit of measurement for time. 10 of these within a cycle. not sure how to notate this lol.
	<br>
	<br> <b> Shift: </b> 200 cycles. Kind of equal to a month in significance? 5 Shifts in a Revolution.
	<br> - Notation: [0000.200]
	<br>
	<br> <b> Revolution: </b> 1000 cycles. Equivalent in significance to a year, but it's definitely much longer. I envision the timescale this world operates off of as much larger than our own.
	<br> - Notation: [0001.000]
	<br>
	<br>
	<b> Dynasty: </b> 100 Revolutions. I lifted this term from the pearls in-game, but it was probably something different. Lowkey considering making this longer but idk.
	<br> - Notation: [0100.000]

 <a href="#iterclass" data-bs-toggle="collapse"> <h2>Iterator Classifications</h2> </a>      
  <div id="iterclass" class="collapse">
	<p class="blurb-text px-2" style="font-size:90%">
<span style="font-size: 115%;"> <u> Construction / Species </u> </span>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b> Iterator: </b> Superstructure is a necessary component of the design. (Sometimes called "Standard Iterators"). 
		<br>
		<b> Mobile Iterators: </b> "Iterator" Units made without the Superstructure as a core component of the design. May have smaller structures that mimic Iterator superstructures. Sometimes considered as a different classification of purposed organism.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<span style="font-size:115%;"> <u> Roles </u> </span>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b> Orthodox: </b> Primary focus is Iteration (Great Problem). "Proper" Iterators.
		<br>
		<span style="font-size:90%; color:#a4a2a9;"><em> ◦ Ex: Looks To The Moon, Sand-Smoothed Reckoning</em> </span>
		<br>
		<b> Utility/Utilitarian: </b> Primary focus is providing some sort of service or utility, with a lesser focus on Iteration. These units still have the capacity to Iterate as a forward-facing measure for an inevitable public mass ascension.
		<br> <span style="font-size:90%; color:#a4a2a9;"><em> ◦ Ex: Everlasting Lotus Waters (Medical Facility)</em> </span>
		<br>
		<b> Unconvential: </b> Units with a primary focus that does not fit either of these categories.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<span style="font-size:115%;"><u> Additional Classifications </u> </span>
		<br>
		<br> <b> City-Handler: </b> An Iterator of any role that is legally permitted to host a City (Long-Term and large-scale Residency).
		<span style="font-size:90%; color:#a4a2a9;"><em> ◦ Ex: Looks To The Moon, Sand-Smoothed Reckoning, Everlasting Lotus Water, etc... </em></span>

	<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-size:115%;"><u> Waves / Movements </u> </span>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b> Waves/Movements:</b> Waves are overarching categories that vary in length. They tend to end on a new Dynasty. Each Wave is separated into Movements, and each Movement is a Dynasty (100 revolutions) long. Inspired by Sol (<a href="https://prismsoup.tumblr.com/"> prismsoup </a>). Waves and Movements help give a sense of timescale, though there is an air of superiority around those of the first Wave, as it is seen as more "proper" than the others. <br>
		<br>
		Classification Example: (MIP AU) Iterator Project Looks To The Moon, Orthodox City-Handler. Wave 1, Movement 4. 
		<br>
		<br> Shortened Classification Example: (MIP AU) Looks To The Moon, Orthodox City-Handler. Wave 1.

<a href="#ittytime" data-bs-toggle="collapse"> <p class="blurb-text px-2 text-center" style="font-size:90%"> A timeline of Iterator Production in the MIP AU. There's a graph here!!! </p></a>
<div id="ittytime" class="collapse">
	<p class="text-center"> <img class=" mx-auto" src="https://file.garden/ZiQlt37XCVFewNs4/MIP%20Logs/Misc%20Graphics/MIP_iterator_timeline.png" style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%; border-radius: 5px"> </p>

	<p class="blurb-text px-2" style="font-size:90%"> This calendar was created with the Void Fluid Revolution. I'm not 100% sure about this (it seems perhaps too long) so it might change again later. Regardless, there's a clean divide between the Void Fluid Revolution and the time before then. This isn't really relevant for the purposes of the AU, though.
		<br>
	<b> Prototypes: ~0200 - 0300 </b>
	<br> A special Wave, sometimes lumped in with Wave 1 as a "Movement 0".
	<br> <b> Wave 1: 0300 - 0800 </b>
		<br> Five Glorious Movement. Each Wave was initially planned to have Five Movements, but this did not pan out.
	<br>
		<b> Wave 2: 0800 - 1000 </b> 
		<br> Two Movements; a pefectly respectable wave. Cut off so Wave 3 could start on 1000. Progress plateaued for a while as there was more focus on meeting uniform standards. (Units from this Era are sometimes called "Plateau" Units.)
		<br> 
		<b> Wave 3: 1000 - 1100 </b>
		<br> One Movement. Rapid advancements and shifting viewpoints at the tail end of the first movement signaled an abrupt turnover. There were debates about merging this with the Waves that preceded / followed it, but it was decided to be too much hassle. Often overlooked. Sand-Smoothed Reckoning was constructed within this time period.
		<br>
		<b> Wave 4: 1100 - 1400 </b> 
		<br> Three Movements. The next "Proper" Wave.
		<br>
	<b> Wave 5: 1400 - 1543 </b> 
	<br> Two Movements. (One incomplete) Some people like to lump this in with Wave Four, but those people are annoying elitists. The Mobile Iterator Project began around the end of its first movement. </p>
