<p class="blurb-text text-center mt-3 px-3"> What is the "Mobile Iterator Project?"
<br>
<br>
The "Mobile Iterator Project" details a Rain World <b> Alternate Universe </b> focused around the titular Project and its relevant characters. It's primarily focused on Original Characters rather than pre-existing ones, and the lore and themes <b> differ quite drastically </b> from both Vanilla and Downpour. There are major elements of world-building that do not comply with either canon; be warned. (also sacrilege) It takes inspiration from others' OC-focused fanworks like Daszombes' "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J41WOb_Lsa0&list=PLUl8awHLnNLyb3Spg1QEI2uiOUx98ql_l">Iterator Logs</a>" and my friends' worldbuilding and characters. My friends have helped me a lot! ^^
<br>
<br>
Here's the in-universe Mission Statement:</p>

	<blockquote class="blockquote">
		<p class="blurb-text text-left px-3 !important"> The “Mobile Iterator Project” (MIP) is a project created and directed by a Benefactor named "No Cost Too Great" (NCTG) with the stated goal of supporting Iterators in their productivity, maintenance, and longevity, so that they can operate at maximum efficiency, even after the inevitable mass ascension. ‘MIP Units—Iterators created under the project—are created puppet-first in the "MIP Development Center" and later assigned to Local Groups, where their structures are built to support the Iterators around them.  
<br>
			<br>
Uniquely, their personalities are heavily based around singular, specific Architects (Benefactors) who donate their memories and qualia. The exception to this is TWR, who features a more traditional personality module. In total, there are 99 MIP Units, with IDs ranging from 01 to 99..</p>
	</blockquote>

<p class="blurb-text text-center mt-3 px-3"> The impetus for this AU was asking "If the Iterators are left behind as Gifts to the World for possible millennia, who shall take care of them?" Of course all Iterators come with various self-repair technologies (like in Downpour!), but there are certain tasks that would be better-fit for a sentient being to help with, such as degradation of communications arrays or delivery. MIP Units are modeled after the Benefactors (Iterator-Builders) specifically to ensure that their presence shall never truly be absent.
<br>
<br>
"What is Rain World?" a cool awesome indie game you should buy and play RIGHT NOW. (link) but if for some reason you've stumbled onto here without already knowing, here's a link to the wiki's entry on <a href="https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/Iterator">Iterators</a>, I guess. 
<br>
	<br> If you have any questions about anything, you can send an ask to my Tumblr or send me a DM somewhere. Strawpage sort of works, but it's better for more casual questions, since it doesn't have any sort of archival for answers. Links are under the Links tab. Thank you!
	<br>
<br>
Special thanks to syrupyy for helping me fix the code on this ^^

			    <br>
		    - Palette changes, outfit swaps (nothing suggestive or nsfw), and you can play with their designs a bit as long as you respect the earlier criteria. Simplifications and minor stylistic changes are also fine. 
			    <br>
			    - Being asked before drawing my OCs with yours is appreciated, but not necessary. just try to keep the other stuff in mind (body types, proper characterization)
			    <br>
			    - I also appreciate being tagged if you post the fanart somewhere so i can see it 
		    <br>
			    <br>
		    <b>Characterization Boundaries:</b>
			    <br>
			    - Please do not headcanon them. Don't change my characters' genders, orientations (if stated), major personality traits, etc. They're all very important to me.
			    <br>
			    - In a similar vein, please ask me before attempting to include my OCs in your personal lore/worldbuilding. If you want me to include yours in mine, you can also ask.
			    <br>
			   	 <br>
			    <b> NSFW/Suggestive: </b> Do not make NSFW content of my OCs. I will block you.

			    <br>
			    	<br>
			    <b> "Simping"/Showing Romantic Interest: </b> This is generally fine with most OCs as long as you're not too aggressive or suggestive about it. Big NO for Frosted Briar (child) and Starlight Symphony (self-insert), though.
				    <br>
			    <br>
			    <b> Using my OCs as Icon/Banner: </b> Fine with credit as long as it is not SLS.

			    <br>
			    <br>
			    <b>Making your Own MIP Unit:</b>  This is currently not available, sorry. Eventually, when I have a more solid grasp on fundamental worldbuilding and important lore, I'll let people do it, but right now it's still too shaky. I only give them to my friends so far.

<div class="test" my3 p3>  
	<h1> Q: What is a MIP Unit? </h1>
	<p class="blurb-text px-2" style="font-size:90%"> Mobile Iterator Project Units are "Mobile Iterators" constructed under the Mobile Iterator Project. MIP Units are a unique (and trademarked) classification of purposed organisms, and they have several key characteristics. Each MIP Unit has an ID, ranging from 01 to 99, and their specialized ID drones are necessary to their proper functionality. 
<br>
		<br>
Uniquely, every MIP Unit (except TWR) has a personality based off of an existing Architect/Benefactor that has donated memories and qualia. These are referred to as "Personality Donors", and their identities are kept private out of respect to all parties involved. (With a few exceptions, like NMMST) These personalities and experiences allow them to carry the perspectives of Architects/Benefactors, allowing them to become proper replacements for maintenance and service workers. Their capabilities are similar to those of the average Benefactor, though their status as machines allows them greater intelligence and productivity. It should be noted that MIP Units, as purposed organisms, do not have Citizens' Rights or legal Citizenship. 
		<br>
		<br>

MIP Units are constructed puppet-first in the Mobile Iterator Project Development Center. Each MIP Unit is assigned to a Local Group through a process titled "Group Assignment". Once a Group Assignment has been received, MIP Units receive specialized education and training to perform the roles required of them by their Assigned Local Groups. Once this process has been finalized, a Unit is said to have completed their "Group Integration", and they leave the Development Center for their own specialized structures. These structures have a focus on providing a service or utility, such as material production, and they are much smaller to minimize environmental disruption and save on resources. MIP Units have the ability to connect to these structures for greater functionality, though they do not have enough processing power to Iterate on the Great Problem. Their purpose is to supplement other Iterator Units, anyways. 
<br>
		<br>
House Representatives may commission a MIP Unit to be assigned to Local Groups that their respective Houses hold influence within. However, they cannot choose the designs or personalities, as this would conflict with the Director's artistic vision. Generally, MIP Units favor appealing and expressive designs above overt functionality, but any limiting factors can be supplemented by their assigned Local Groups, if they so wish. Their signature doll-like aesthetic means they may lack strength, but the lighter materials used in their puppets enable easier transportation and handling. Most MIP Units come with a handle at the back of their nape to make this easier. </p>

<h1> Basic Terms </h1>
<br>
<p class="blurb-text px-2" style="font-size:90%"> <b>Benefactor:</b> Term for a member of the civlization that built the Iterators.
<br>
<br>
I think I will get rid of Architect bc I use Benefactor more and more than one term is too confusing. sorry chat.
<br>
<br>
<b>Local Group:</b> A collection of several Iterators, generally within the same "Sector." Position within a Sector is denoted by one or two smaller letters corresponding to cardinal direction. (c for center, s for south, ne for northeast, etc) They have their own hierarchies, and their members tend to work together. The number of Iterators in a LG varies.
<br>
<em>Example: Silent Valley Local Group (Sector S2), Everlasting Lotus Waters (S2e) </em>
<br>
	<br>
<b>Group Senior:</b> The eldest member of a Local Group. Takes on administrative and managerial duties in regards to its other members, to varying degrees. Depends on the House(s) behind the members of said Local Group.
<br> 
<em>Example: Everlasting Lotus Waters</em>
<br>
	<br>

<b>Group Supervisor:</b> A member of the Local Group who takes on the responsibilities of the Group Senior despite not being the eldest unit. Generally given in circumstances where a Group Senior is unable to effectively perform their duties or due to outside influence ("Wealthy House Said So").
<br>
<span style="font-size:80%; color:#a4a2a9;"> I'm like 90% sure I subconsciously lifted this from Daszombes's Iterator Logs so Obligatory Plug</span>
<br>
<em>Ex: Perpetual Umbra</em>
<br>
	<br>

<b>Administrator:</b> A individual with Administrative Permissions over an Iterator. How much control or influence an Administrator has over their assigned Unit varies (from tech support to complete authority), and some Iterators are given multiple Administrators.
<br>
<em>Ex: NCTG (PU, TWR, SLS, FB)</em>
<br>
	<br>

<b>Creator:</b> An uncommon title for an Individual primarily responsible for the creation of an Iterator Unit. Most Iterator Projects necessitate the cooperation of multiple individuals, so reserving this title for one person is rather egotistical. <span style="color:#a4a2a9;"> (Since MIP Units are so much smaller in scale, it's... <em>slightly</em> less haughty for NCTG to adopt this title.) </span>
	<br>
	<br> <b> The Great Problem: </b> A "problem" that seeks a solution to finding a way to ascend every living being, including the Lesser Beings of the world that lack the natural capacity for enlightenment. Iterators were (at least originally) created to solve it.
	<br>
	<br> <b> The Global Council:</b> The highest political authority. For example, the Council was responsible for overseeing public mass ascension. Representative assembly elected from constituent Houses.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b> Councillor: </b> An acting member of the Global Council.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b> The Ethics Committe: </b> Legal infrastructure of the Global Council. Contains the justice system, law enforcement, etc. Has detachments in all other Committees.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Void Fluid Research Committee: </b> Oversees and sponsors research related to Void Fluid and the Void Sea. Has been known to help certain controversial Projects get past the Ethics Committee (on the grounds that one that does not properly understand their field cannot properly determine its ethicality).

	<h1> MIP Terms </h1>
	<br>
	<p class="blurb-text px-2" style="font-size:90%"> <b> Director: </b> The Director of the Mobile Iterator Project. They orchestrate and organize its members and goals. "Director" is a title of respect, and MIP Units generally address No Cost Too Great with this honorific. (It's catchier than saying Mx. Cost, so even people unrelated to the Project will often refer to them as "the Director". 
	<br>
		<br> <b> Assistant: </b> Title for MIP Units that have managerial responsibilities and carry out the Director's will. They are right under the Director in the MIP Unit hieararchy. These Units have certain administrative privileges over other MIP Units (and each other), and they are directly overseen by No Cost Too Great themself.
		<br>
		<br> <b> Implement: </b> A fancy title for Units that serve the Mobile Iterator Project in their duties. Like employees, basically. For example, Plume Of Embers is involved in manufacturing merchandise, and Seafoam, Glimmering In Sunlight serves as the Head of Security. They are beneath Assistants in the hierarchy, but above regular MIP Units.
		<br>
		<br> <b>MIP Unit: </b> Mobile Iterator Units specifically constructed under the Mobile Iterator Project. Not to be confused with other Mobile Iterators or Standard Iterators with mobile puppets. MIP Units are their own classification of purposed organism, though they may also be classified as a specific subset of "Mobile Iterator" under Iterator classification standards. Bootlegged productions are illegal. (You can view their general schematics <a href="https://toyhou.se/28365003.mip-unit-overview"> here </a>)
		<br>
		<br> <b> Personality Donor: </b> Every MIP Unit (except TWR) is built from a personality base made up of qualia and memories donated by specific architects. These are referred to as Personality Donors, though their identities are kept private out of respect to all parties involved.
		<br>
		<br> <b> MIP Development Center:</b> The building in which MIP Units are assembled, activated, and developed. This building also serves as a center to interface with clients, and it is split into several wings depending on the function. (Conferencing Wing, General Development Wing, Administrative Wing) The building is located in Sand-Smoothed Reckoning's Mesa City.
		<br>
	<br> <b> Group Assignment: </b> The process by which MIP Units are assigned to support Local Groups. Once they receive a Group Assignment, MIP Units receive specialized education and/or training to suit the needs of their respective Groups. They also spend time introducing themselves to their groupmates and familiarizing themselves with their respective Houses and Administrators. Once this process has been completed, a MIP Unit reaches <b>Local Group Integration </b> and officially leaves the Development Center. Certain units (Assistants and FB) must receive delayed Group Assignments due to extenuating circumstances.
	<br> <em> Ex: Seafoam, Glimmering In Sunlight (Local Group L7), Plume Of Embers (Local Group R2) </em></p>

	<h1> Time Notation </h1>
	<br>
	<p class="blurb-text px-2" style="font-size:90%">
		Generally, my timestuff works with tenths and fifths, given the religious significance of 10 (Highest Karmic State) and 5 (The Five Urges). I also base stuff around wheels due to the Cycle's nature as something that is ever-turning. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<b> Cycle: </b> In Iterator/Architect scale, this is somewhat close in <em> significance </em> to a day, probably. I'm not making conversions to human time, sorry. 
	<br> - Notation: [0000.001] 
	<br>
	<br> <b> Micro-Cycle: </b> A finer unit of measurement for time. 10 of these within a cycle. not sure how to notate this lol.
	<br>
	<br> <b> Shift: </b> 200 cycles. Kind of equal to a month in significance? 
	<br> - Notation: [0000.200]
	<br>
	<br> <b> Revolution: </b> 1000 cycles. Equivalent in significance to a year, but it's definitely much longer. I envision the timescale this world operates off of as much larger than our own.
	<br> - Notation: [0001.000]
	<br>
	<br>
	<b> Dynasty: </b> 100 Revolutions. I lifted this term from the pearls in-game.
	<br> - Notation: [0100.000]

		<br>
		<em> ex: Looks To The Moon, Sand-Smoothed Reckoning</em>
		<br>
		<b> Utility/Utilitarian: </b> Primary focus is providing some sort of service or utility, with a lesser focus on Iteration. These units still have the capacity to Iterate as a forward-facing measure for an inevitable public mass ascension.
		<br> <em> Ex: Everlasting Lotus Waters (Medical Facility)</em>
		<br>
		<b> Unconvential: </b> Units with a primary focus that does not fit either of these categories.
		<br>

		<span style="font-size:115%;"><em> <u> Additional Classifications </u></em> </span>
		<br>
		<br> <b> City-Handler: </b> An Iterator of any role that is legally permitted to host a City.
		<br> <em> Ex: Looks To The Moon </em>
		<br>
		<br>
	<b> Generations/Waves:</b> Generations are overarching categories that vary in length. Generally end on a new Dynasty Each Generation is separated into Waves, and each Wave is a Dynasty (100 revolutions) long. Inspired by Sol prismsoup. (link) Gens and Waves help give a sense of timescale, though there is an air of superiority around those of the first Generation, as it is seen as more "proper" than the others. <br>
		<br>
		Classification Example: (MIP AU) Iterator Project Looks To The Moon, Orthodox City-Handler. Generation 1, Wave 4.

	<h1> Generation / Wave Timescale </h1>
	
	<p class="blurb-text px-2" style="font-size:90%"> This calendar was created with the Void Fluid Revolution. I'm not 100% sure about this (it seems perhaps too long) so it might be subject to changes haha. I'm very sorry if it changes later. Please help me I don't know what I am doing. sorry. add image here
		<br>
	<b> Prototypes: ~0200 - 0300 </b>
	<br> A special wave, sometimes lumped in with Gen as a "Wave 0".
	<br> <b> Gen 1: 0300 - 0800 </b>
		<br> Five Glorious Waves. Each Generation was initially planned to have Five Waves, but this did not pan out.
	<br>
		<b> Gen 2: 0800 - 1000 </b> 
		<br> Two Waves; a pefectly respectable generation. Cut off so Gen 3 could start on 1000. Progress plateaued for a while as there was more focus on meeting uniform standards.
		<br> 
		<b> Gen 3: 1000 - 1100 </b>
		<br> One Wave. Rapid advancements and shifting viewpoints at the tail end of the first wave signaled an abrupt turnover. There were debates about merging this with the Generations that preceded / followed it, but it was decided to be too much hassle. Often overlooked. Sand-Smoothed Reckoning was constructed within this time period, funnily enough.
		<br>
		<b> Gen 4: 1100 - 1400 </b> 
		<br> Three Waves. The next "Proper" Generation.
		<br>
	<b> Gen 5: 1400 - 1583 </b> 
	<br> Two Waves. (Or, close to that, at least) Some people like to lump this in with Generation Four, but those people are annoying elitists. This Generation isn't very highly regarded, but there was some fascinating experimentation near the end. The Mobile Iterator Project began around the start of the Second Wave. </p>
